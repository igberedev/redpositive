                Thatâ€™s why we created Citizen Hacks, a student-run hackathon that encourages
                the next generation of innovators and users to actively participate in building
                a digital world that works for everyone. Citizen Hacks is a platform for university, 
                college and high school students to collaborate with educators, businesses, nonprofits, 
                and governmental organizations in exploring the challenges and potential of creating 
                technology that benefits society.
